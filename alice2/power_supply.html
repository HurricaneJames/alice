        The power supply that came with the modem case provided, we think, 18
        volts AC.  (It was really just a transformer.)  We needed 5
        volts DC, so we set out to modify it.  We used a bridge
        rectifier to turn the AC into pulsating DC, a capacitor to
        smooth that out, and a 7505 to clamp the voltage to 5
        volts.<P>

        We went through a
        considerable amount of trouble with a metal clamp to cut out
        a hole large enough for an amp meter.  This meter was
        invaluable when building later boards, because it showed us
        when we had a short circuit or anything suspicious in our
        wiring.  Normally we hovered around 1 amp, and a
        short-circuit would peg the meter all the way to the
        right.<P>

        One problem is that the 7505 can only pass about half an
        amp, and we were not sure that would be enough.  Also, Lawrence had
        made a mistake in his design -- the "ground" that the power
        supply generated was indeed always 5 volts lower than the
        power line, but the pair oscillated at 60 Hz between 0/5
        volts and -5/0 volts.  This worked fine when the Alice II
        was working in isolation, but when we hooked it up to
        another computer (through a serial line), the grounds got
        connected, confusing the PC's serial board.<P>

        So we dropped that and just used a regular PC power supply,
        which gave us more than enough power.  We missed the amp
        meter, and in retrospect we should have added one in series
        with the PC power supply.<P>
