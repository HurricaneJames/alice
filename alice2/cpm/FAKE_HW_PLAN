    sector read and write are immediately performed
    disks must be 8MB binary files each; show command to fill with 0xe5
        python -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.write("\xe5"*(8192*1024));'
    terminal is emulated as telnet client - first writes are batched
      up, written on first connection
need BIOS, put at 0xfe00 like Donn Stewart
    character and disk routines easy
    disk table = 8MB files
    careful SECTRAN bug
Give BIOS/CCP/BDOS a try with putbin
    and BIOS cold boot
    put something like SARGON into 0x100
steal putsys from Donn
steal boot sector loader from Donn to sector 0
steal disks from Humongous ISO
