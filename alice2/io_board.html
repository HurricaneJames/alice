                    Once we had built the CPU and memory board
                        we prototyped an LCD display for output from
                    the Alice II.  Later we added an interface to a standard PC
                    keyboard using an EPROM and microcontroller.  The
                    microcontroller brought serial I/O for free.  Thus our I/O
                    board gave Alice II user input and output and a way for us
                    to control Alice II from another computer.

                    Before we had the I/O board, we built a simple LCD
                    controller that plugged right into the alice bus.
                    I mean, it was
                    fun single stepping the CPU and watching the address and
                    data accesses on the debug board, but that got boring real
                    quick.  At first we used a backlit 1 line by 8 character
                    LCD that Brad found cheap at Halted Electronic Supply, but
                    later we ordered a 2 line by 16 character LCD (no
                    backlight) from JDR Microdevices so that we'd have more
                    room.  Brad thinks that the backlight was more important in
                    the end than more room just because the garage was usually
                    pretty dark.  The box in the photograph to the left
                    contained the LCD and the interface logic.  You can see two
                    DB-25 connectors sticking out the top from which we ran
                    cables to the Alice II bus.  Both LCDs we used were typical
                    of a lot of contemporary LCD designs; the host circuit
                    sends <i>data</i> bytes to store ASCII characters on the
                    display and <i>instruction</i> bytes to clear the display,
                    set the cursor position, initialize the controller, etc.
                    The interface board we built had a simple decoder circuit
                    to turn I/O writes to address 2 and 3 into data and
                    instruction writes.  You can read our Z-80 ROM library for
                    accessing the LCD on our <a href="software.html"> software
                        page</a>.

        After we built the LCD controller, it seemed natural to design an input
        device.  At first we thought it would have been really cool to buy one of
        those surplus membrane keyboards that keep popping up.  But we realized
        that we'd have to build a complicated latching and interface circuit
        for such a beast.  So we finally decided to build a standard AT-style
        keyboard interface so we could use any old AT keyboard lying around.
        (And, at the time, Brad had several.)  <p>

                    PC-AT keyboards (and PS/2 keyboards) use a pretty simple
                    serial protocol to send keystrokes.  We went to the
                    internet (our favorite reference) and found several
                    descriptions of the keyboard protocol.  At first, we
                    considered a simple latching circuit that would interrupt
                    the Z-80 directly and allow it to decode the serial signal
                    coming through.

                    While considering that design, however, we found that JDR
                    Microdevices was selling several variants of Microchip's
                    PIC 16Cxx microcontrollers.  We decided it would be fun to
                    build a circuit with one of these microcontrollers that
                    latched up the keyboard signal itself and then sent
                    fully-formed keyboard scan code bytes to the CPU.  The Z-80
                    would then convert these scan codes
                    from the keyboard circuit
                    into ASCII characters (taking into account the
                    state of shift and control keys).  This circuit
                    slowly developed into
                    the I/O board.  The black console box shown above with the
                    LCD also had the 5-pin keyboard connector in it, so we
                    borrowed two bus lines to carry serial data from the
                    console box to the I/O board.  (For extra luck we also put
                    a reset button on the console box and tied that to the bus
                    reset line.)

                    It turned out that the PIC 16C65 had a serial port built
                    right in!  So we added a MAX232 voltage converter to the
                    board and gave ourselves an honest-to-god RS232 serial
                    port.  We later used this serial line to transfer programs
                    and data from a PC running Linux.  The 16C65 also had
                    several I/O pins left over after our needs were met, so we
                    decided to extend those pins to yet another DB-25 just in
                    case we wanted to use them for something.  The sketch to
                    the right shows the PIC microcontroller in the center
                    connected to the Alice II bus on the left, the MAX232
                    voltage regulator at the bottom, and the spare connector to
                    the right that exposed the unused I/O pins.
