	The clock board's responsibility is to put a clock signal
        on the clock pin of the bus.  We wanted control over the
        clock speed, so we had switches to put the board into one
        of three states: single-step, variable, and full-speed.<P>

        In single-step mode, a push button toggled the clock
        signal manually.  This was useful to debug the memory and
        CPU boards later.<P>

        In variable mode, a potentiometer let us go from about
        0.1 Hz to 1 kHz.  This was useful if the section we wanted
        to single-step was far into the program -- we'd run the
        program in this mode until the program got close to the
        problem section, then go into single-step mode.<P>

        oscillator.<P>

        Three LEDs were useful in the above three modes.  The
        first LED showed the actual clock.  The second showed the
        clock divided by 1024, and the third divided by a
        million.<P>

        The card also has a reset button, which just grounds the
        active-low reset pin of the bus.<P>

        The clock board basically worked except for the
        variable mode.  We had taken the design from a magazine
        that used an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit.  This proved
        to be unreliable, so we later replaced this with a
        daughterboard that used a 555 timer chip.  The notebook
        page below shows the design with the RC circuit -- we can't
        find the page with the design of the daugherboard.<P>

        memory boards, we ran
        into all sorts of problems that we were able to debug easily
        using the single-step mode and the debug board.  It's extremely
        important to develop good debugging tools early in any
        project.<P>
