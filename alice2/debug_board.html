        bus.  This includes two 7-segment LED digits for the data
        pins, four digits for the address pins, and ten individual
        LEDs: four IRQs (interrupt request pins), memory read, memory
        write, I/O read, I/O write, reset, and NMI (non-maskable interrupt).<P>

            HEIGHT="164"> </A>The design
        of the debug board is fairly straightforward.
        The individual LEDs are hooked up to the bus through
        inverters (since these lines are active-low) and through
        resistor packs.  The data and address pins go through
        4-bit-to-7-segment-LED chips (4495s).<P>

        We used the debug board extensively when building the memory
        and CPU boards.  We didn't use it after that because we couldn't
        run the I/O board any slower than full speed and that prevented
        us from doing single-stepping of the Z-80 code.<P>
