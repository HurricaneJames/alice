I want the design process to go something like this:
	specifications
	draw schematic using Brad's schematic tool
	use Lawrence's routing tool + a route editor to lay the board
	test using some form of input;
		calculate timing & power requirements, verify design
	print board on transparenc(ies)
	register, transfer, etch, tin, socket
	test
	assemble in enclosure
	test
	fill out report with specification, schematic, testing results, 
		photos, sample code if necessary, and final summary
