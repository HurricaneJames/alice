Check connections on all data pins
Check all input signals are 
	- connected to an output
	- or connected to ground or supply
Check that all output signals
	- go somewhere if they are supposed to
	- are pulled up or down if they may go high-impedance and the
	 corresponding inputs need a stiff signal from that output
All clocked inputs from switches/toggles must be conditioned
Make sure supply and ground are connected and
	current available is sufficient for ...
	connections to power CAN CARRY that much current
	are decoupled at the chip if possible
Make sure incoming frequencies do not exceed specifications for
	circuit
Check logic two different ways if possible.
