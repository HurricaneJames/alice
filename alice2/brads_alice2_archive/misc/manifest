****** Alice Phase I
	Z-80, RAM, very simple I/O, variable slow clock
	Purpose: Show that we can start, get used to tools.
	First show wired prototype, then build enclosed pieces.
	FINISH: March 31st, 1995
CPU module
	Z-80, RAM, ROM, decoding, plus simple hex digit byte display
	power supply if possible.
	provide ROM which has three modes:
		programmer provided program in RAM
		ROM goes to console for monitor
		if no program or console, do cool stuff on byte display
	DONE: Wednesday, Febrary 22nd, 1995
clock modules
	one is adjustable
	one is fixed 1 MHz or maybe even max speed of processor
	FINISH: March 1st
more advanced output
	six hex digits
	FINISH: March 10th
input
	8 dip + 1 enable toggle
	FINISH: March 20th
software
	simple rom monitor
	FINISH: March 31st
document on Web page and in notebook
	FINISH: March 15th, 1995
****** Alice Phase II
	Z-80, ROM, RAM, rudimentary I/O bus with interrupts, memory mapped
	I/O?, Serial peripheral, parallel peripheral, full 2.5 MHz speed
	Purpose: Get used to the idea of I/O bus, interrupts, and timing.
	FINISH: June 15th
CPU module
	Z-80, RAM, ROM, decoding, full speed clock plus clock chip for
	timed interrupts, console with LCD display and PC keyboard (if
	possible)
	FINISH: April 15th
Serial peripheral
	Z-80 SIO
	Should be able to communicate with PC or Mac serial port (with
	adapter...)
	FINISH: April 20th
Parallel peripheral
	Z-80 PIO, capable of communicating with external TTL
	should it be able to communicate with a PC parallel port?
	FINISH: April 30
video peripheral
	NTSC monochrome video with dual-ported RAM and memory mapped I/O
	from processor (256x128x1)
	FINISH: June 1st
keyboard peripheral
	keyboard if not implemented in CPU module
software
	ROM monitor running on LCD display
	basic interpreter for TV graphics module
	FINISH: June 1st
****** Alice Phase III
	68000 (maybe a 68030), ROM, RAM, real I/O bus with
	interrupts, wait states, possibly DMA, at full possible speed
	like 6 or 8 MHz, drivers on ROM on cards, memory mapped I/O
	Purpose: Build a computer capable of real work and necessary
	complexity to drag us into real computer design
	FINISH: November 1st
CPU module
	motherboard fits in a PC case, real card connectors, keyboard and
	LCD display built-in; LCD is console in the case that video driver
	of any kind is not found.
serial/parallel card
640x480 video card (color?)
SCSI card
test an exploratory accelerated video card?
RAM expansion in the way of DRAM SIMMS?
ROM SIMMS?
****** Alice Phase IV
	32-bit CPU, ROM, RAM, plug-and-play cards, C compiler and real
	OS. Comparable to mid-range computers of the present
	FINISH: December 1996
****** Alice Phase V
	A real machine that people could buy
	multiprocessor
	accelerated video
	FINISH: December 1997
