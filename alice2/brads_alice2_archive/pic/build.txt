EPIC Programmer Assembly Instructions

1.   Solder in resistors R1, and R3-R12.  It is recommended that
     trimmer RV1 be used instead of resistor R2.

2.   Solder in sockets for U1 and U2 if U2 is not a ZIF socket.

3.   Solder in trimmer RV1.

4.   Solder in transistors Q1 and Q2.

5.   Solder in capacitors C1-3.  Note the polarity of C1 and C2.  C1 is
     not necessary for battery only operation.

6.   Solder in bridge BR1 and J2 if AC operation is desired.

7.   Solder in DB25 connector J1.

8.   Solder in LEDs LED1 and LED2.  Be sure the flat side of each
     LED is away from connector J1.

9.   Solder in the 10 pin header J3.

10.  Solder in Battery ON 2 pin header.  Place the shorting jumper
     across the header before soldering to prevent the pins from
     moving when heated.  A piece of wire may be soldered into the
     header holes if the Battery ON jumper is not desired.  In that
     case the batteries may be connected and disconnected to turn
     the programmer on and off.

11.  Solder in the 9 volt battery snaps B1 and B2.  Make sure the
     polarity noted on the board matches the polarity of the 9 volt
     battery terminals.  Double check this operation as getting one or
     both backwards is not a good thing.

12.  If U2 is a ZIF socket, solder it in now.

13.  Solder REG1 and REG2 into place.  Be sure the larger heat sink
     side is away from connector J1.

Before proceeding, check the almost completed board for the proper voltages.

Adjust trimmer RV1 to about the middle of its range.

Connect an AC adapter or the two 9 volt batteries and Battery ON jumper. 
At this point neither regulator should get hot.  If either one does, immediately
disconnect power and check for improper battery connector polarity or
regulators in backwards.

Measure the output of the variable regulator REG2 and adjust trimmer RV1
to give about 13.5 volts.  The easiest place to measure the voltage is between
the heatsink tab of the 7805T REG1 (ground) and the end of R1 furthest from
the battery connectors.

Measure the output of the 7805T REG1 for 5 volts.  The best place to
measure is between pin 7 (ground) and pin 14 of the 7407 U1.

If the voltages are not correct, check the polarity of the battery connections
and the regulators.  Also check to see that all of the other components are
properly soldered in place.

14.  Once all of the voltages check out, install U1 7407 in the 14 pin
     socket.  Make sure the end with the notch (pin 1) is away from
     the battery connectors.
