-----------------------------
makerom probably takes output of makefield.
makefield outputs sync and timing information.
makefield is asking me for a clock speed.  I'm not sure what
  I said last time...  Probably 11.whatever divided by four.  I'll
  try it against timing.bin and see if there's a difference.
Looks like it works like this:
    makefield 2.7648 | makerom image.pbm > romfile.bin
    I think romfile.bin contains the raw bits to write to the EPROM,
      plus image.pbm.
    The emitted numbers2.bin looked the same length as numbers.bin, which
      is encouraging.  I went ahead and copied numbers2.bin to
      the win95 partition as /eprom/video/timing2.bin


makerom
    take output of makefield
    take PNM as parameter
    scale PNM to size of visible pixel area
    dither as necessary
    store output as 1 or n EPROMS plus a reset bit
    option for 2 EPROMS with 1 reset bit or 1 bitsliced EPROM with 1 reset
      bit used as toggle of chip/bit select (1 reset bit, 2 sync bits,
      2 video bits)
