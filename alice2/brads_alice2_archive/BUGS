Pin 18 on the lower bus is disconnected between slot 1 and slot 2 (the
second and third slots from the left).  That means slots 0 and 1 are
disconnected from the rest of the bus.  This is mostly okay, since the
clock board doesn't use pin 18 (which is address line 9), and slot 0 is
pretty much unusable by any board with moderate width, so with clock in
slot 1 everything is okay.

Evidence (the debug board doesn't show MR change when in slot 7)
suggests that pin 19 (/MR) is disconnected between slot 6 and 7 (the
second and first slots from the right).  Not that we care about seeing
/MR if everything is working, but neither the CPU nor memory card can
be put in slot 7.

CPU board
----------
It seems that the CPU lowers /MREQ just prior to a read cycle for no
reason; probably just the way the internals work; subsequently MREQ
turns off and then the CPU lowers /MREQ and /RD.  Unfortunately,
our version 1 circuit converts (/MREQ * NOT(/WR) * NOT(/RD)) as /MW.
I think we can get around this by logical-ANDing the existing
OR(MREQ, IORQ) signal with a new OR(RD,WR).  This would nicely use
up the remaining unused OR and AND on the version 1 board.
