<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>This Web page is about a 2010 through 2014 adaptation of the AZ80 cross-assembler as described below.

<h2>A18 history</h2>

<p>AZ80 is one of a number of cross-assemblers in C source, freely distributed by the developer William C Colley III, through the "C Users Group" or DUG library of C programs of the 1980's and later. I (Herb Johnson) obtained a copy of AZ80 and adapted it to compile under <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/"> the lcc Windows/MS-DOS C compiler</a> to produce a 32-bit MS-DOS executable on the Windows "command line" or "DOS box". 

<p>In 2010 I discussed a previous assembler adaptation with the author, when I adapted his <a href="/memship/a18.html">A18 1802 cross assembler, as described on this linked Web page.</a> That page also points to other cross assemblers from Colley which I've adapted; and discusses the recent status
of CUG. I provide similar Web pages to this one for those.

<p>Changes I've made to AZ80, is to accomodate additional ways to describe numeric values as hex, binary, octal. The syntax "0x<numeric>" was a little
tricky. 

<p>To run AZ80 as a 16-bit MS-DOS program under non-Windows MS-DOS, I compiled it with the former Borland's "Turbo C". The only change was to replace "#include malloc.h" with "#include alloc.h". The executable is AZ80_16.EXE.

<p> <a href="az80.zip">I provide the C sources and executables with my changes clearly marked. There are also docs and sample assembly code.</a> For those who download my version, please advise me about any errors, issues or compliments. I make zero guarantees, offer zero warrenties. I am not responsible for any loss, injury or damage to person or property of any sort. Use entirely at your own risk.
