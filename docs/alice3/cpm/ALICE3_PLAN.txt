new HW board, Alice3HW:
    copy drive management from FakeHW
    Propeller
        accept direct write at port 128 for CONOUT and print to console? telnet?
    PIC
        accept reads and writes at port 0
        READ - next 3 bytes are disk, track, sector
            if disk != count, respond FAILURE
            spend 10 cycles responding with 0, then SUCCESS
            output sector as bytes on read
        WRITE - next 131 bytes are disk, track, sector, sector bytes
            spend 10 cycles responding with 0, then SUCCESS
        CONST
            spend 10 cycles responding with 0, then READY
        CONIN
            keep responding with 0 until actual character typed on console? telnet?
CBIOS
    alice3poll:
        in (0) until not 0
        return response

        call alice3poll
        parse READY / NOTREADY (it will always block or return READY)

    seldsk
        store seldsk number
    settrk 
        store track number

        store sector number
    setdma
        store address

        write PIC_IO_WRITE, disk, sector, track
        write 128 bytes
        call alice3poll
        if NOTREADY, error
        if READY, transfer 128 bytes
