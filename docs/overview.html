            <h1>What Is The Alice Project?</h1>

            <p>The Alice Project is a collection of smaller projects that
            are supposed to teach us about hardware and system software.<p>

            <p>Our original goal was to design, manufacture, and sell a UNIX graphics
            workstation based on the Motorola 88110 microprocessor, which would
            have been state-of-the-art for 1992.  To
            familiarize ourselves with porting UNIX, we ported BSD Net/2 to the
            Macintosh II.  This was freely released as
            <a href="macbsd/">MacBSD</a> (and later as NetBSD/Mac).<p>

            <p>We then went back to hardware, first creating the <a
                href="alice1/">Alice I</a>, a simple Z-80-based
            system with 7-segment display output, then the <a
                href="alice2/">Alice II</a>, a more sophisticated
            computer also based on the Z-80 microprocessor.<p>

            <p>The Alice III was going to be a multi-CPU version of the Alice II with
            more contemporary processors, but we're tired of hardware and want to
            create something that doesn't break by itself from week to week.<p>

            <p>This website documents the Alice I and Alice II projects.<p>
