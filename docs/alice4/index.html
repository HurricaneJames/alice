            <h1>Alice&nbsp;4</h1>

            <p>One lesson we learned from the 
            <a href="../alice3/">Alice&nbsp;3</a> project was that having existing
            software for a platform provided great motivation. For
            the Alice&nbsp;4 we wanted to use a more advanced CPU than the Z80 
            that had powered the previous three projects. Brad wanted
            to do something more ambitious with an ARM (since he worked
            there) and Lawrence wanted to learn how to program FPGAs. Finally,
            the project had to have nostalgic value, as always.</p>

            <p>We decided to make a portable tablet that did nothing but
            run mid-1980's Silicon Graphics (SGI) demos. The demos were
            famous. They were pre-installed on all SGI machines for a decade,
            and they induced instant nostalgia in anyone who had spent time
            with those wonderful workstations. Both of us had worked at SGI and
            we had used the machines extensively.</p>

            <p>We decided to use the Altera Cyclone V SoC chip on the
            <a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=941">DE0-Nano-SoC</a> board (also known as the Atlas-SoC).
            The chip provided a dual-core ARM Cortex A9 and a fairly capable
            FPGA. The board added 1 GB of memory, USB, Ethernet, and plenty
            of GPIO pins.</p>

            <p>We added a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2354">7" touchscreen LCD</a>
            from Adafruit and an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1932">LCD driver</a>.</p>

            <p>The ARM runs Linux and the demos (which we found in a tar file
            on an ancient FTP site). Brad wrote a replacement IrisGL library,
            which performs the transformation, clipping, and lighting, and
            creates an in-memory list of 2D triangles to rasterize. The FPGA
            rasterizes them, performing color interpolation and Z buffering.
            The FPGA also scans the frame buffer to the LCD.</p>

            <p>The demos were slightly modified to make use of the touch
            and tilt interface.</p>
