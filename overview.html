        The Alice Project is a collection of smaller projects that
        are supposed to teach us about hardware and system software.<P>

        Our original goal was to design, manufacture, and sell a UNIX graphics
        workstation based on the Motorola 88110 microprocessor, which would
        have been state-of-the-art for 1992.  To
        familiarize ourselves with porting UNIX, we ported BSD Net/2 to the
        Macintosh II.  This was freely released as
        <A HREF="macbsd/index.html">MacBSD</A> (and later as NetBSD/Mac).<P>

        We then went back to hardware, first creating the <A
            HREF="alice1/index.html">Alice I</A>, a simple Z-80-based
        system with 7-segment display output, then the <A
            HREF="alice2/index.html">Alice II</A>, a more sophisticated
        computer also based on the Z-80 microprocessor.<P>

        The Alice III was going to be a multi-CPU version of the Alice II with
        more contemporary processors, but we're tired of hardware and want to
        create something that doesn't break by itself from week to week.<P>

        This website documents the Alice I and
        Alice II projects.<P>
