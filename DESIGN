Style
------------
no frames, java, javascript
possible menu or navigator bar on left side?
    (no - navigator bars on left side are considered a waste of
    space.  see alertbox.com for lots of good web layout advice)
try to fit no more per page than 30 second download at 28.8K
    Sounds good.

Should we use first or third person?  If we use first, then
we need to have an author to each page, which may make it
difficult for shared pages.  Maybe it's easier to always use
third-person.

What we need:
-------------

    Picture of board inside power supply
    Picture of schematic of power supply, if we have it
    Verify 7505 specs, all specs

    How to make the banner:
        gimp
        Xtns->Script-Fu->Logos->Basic I
            Text String = "The Alice Project"
            Size = 70
            Font = "Charter"
            Background Color = white
            Text Color = black
        Right-click->Layers->Merge Visible Layers (Ctrl-M)
            Choose "Expanded as necessary"
        Right-click->Image->Mode->Grayscale (Alt-G)
        Right-click->File->Save->"banner.gif", take default for all questions
            Choose "Crop" (if asked)
            Check "Interlace"
            Choose OK for "Saving as opaque"
        Right-click->Image->Transforms->Zealous Crop
        Save again
    For smaller banners, use size 40
