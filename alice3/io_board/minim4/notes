USBD_CDC_ReceivePacket(&USBD_Device);
    Finished doing something, kick off another receive
    I assume this is called when the buffer has been drained.
    Is this asynchronous?

HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback(TIM_HandleTypeDef *htim)
    A timeout is set up

UserTxBufPtrIn
    Stick things in here to send back over USB 

static int8_t CDC_Itf_Receive(uint8_t* Buf, uint32_t *Len)
    I think this must be called from USBD_CDC_ReceivePacket
