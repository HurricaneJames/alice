            <h1>Alice 3</h1>

	    <p>In 1995, we built a Z80 computer, the
            <a href="../alice2">Alice II</a>.
            We could download programs to it and display images in
            an NTSC bitmap.
            It didn't work very well.
            </p>

            <p>In 2015, Brad cleaned up his house and tried to power on
            the Alice II.  Although it powered on, we couldn't reliably
            run any programs on it.</p>

            <p>After trying to make it work again for a few months, we
            scrapped all the old hardware and decided to use modern chips
            and tools, with the goal of running CP/M 2.2 on an original
            silicon Z80.</p>

            <p>The Alice 3 uses a Propeller for VGA video and an ARM Cortex M4
            for SD card and PS/2 keyboard.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/lkesteloot/alice/tree/master/alice3">
            The github repository</a> contains the ARM and Propeller
	    firmware, Z80 boot rom, Z80 CP/M BIOS, KiCAD project
	    for the PCB, and an emulator.</p>

	    <p>We produced the PCB at OSHPark.

            </a>
	    You can order the board if you want, but we admit it's
	    less useful without the BOM (part numbers and quantities
	    and sourcing information).  Maybe one day we'll upload
	    the BOM.
