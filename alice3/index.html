            <h1>Alice 3</h1>

	    <p>In 1995, we built a Z80 computer, the
            <a href="../alice2">Alice II</a>.
            We could download programs to it and display images in
            an NTSC bitmap.
            It didn't work very well.
            </p>

            <p>In 2015, Brad cleaned up his house and tried to power on
            the Alice II.  Although it powered on, we couldn't reliably
            run any programs on it.</p>

            <p>After trying to make it work again for a few months, we
            scrapped all the old hardware and decided to use modern chips
            and tools, with the goal of running CP/M 2.2 on an original
            silicon Z80.</p>

            <p>The Alice 3 uses a Propeller for VGA video and an ARM Cortex M4
            for SD card and PS/2 keyboard.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/lkesteloot/alice/tree/master/alice3">The github repository</a> contains the ARM and Propeller firmware, Z80 boot rom, Z80 CP/M BIOS, KiCAD project for the PCB, and an emulator.</p>
