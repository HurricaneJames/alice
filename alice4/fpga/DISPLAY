- To do:
    - Decide on how to route power to both FPGA board and LCD.
    - Add pins to LCD driver board.
    - Read docs on LCD driver board. Summarize here.
- Display:
    - Displays:
        - https://www.adafruit.com/products/2353 (no touch, $40).
        - https://www.adafruit.com/products/2354 (touch, $50).
    - Breakout board to run TFT display:
        - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1932
        - Does backlighting and cable connector.
    - Proposal:
        - Use this display: https://www.adafruit.com/products/2353 (no touch, $40).
        - Use this adapter: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1932
        - Run it at 60 FPS.
        - Use a TFT controller instead of the VGA controller.
    - Display note:
        - Backlight will pull 9.9V at 120mA (page 10 of datasheet).
            - Six strings, so 20mA each, with 3 LEDs per string.
            - Adapter uses this:
                - http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/149/FAN5333B-1006807.pdf
                - Defaults to 25mA.
                - Add all jumpers to get 125mA (datasheet says 120mA, max 180mA).
        - Terms in the datasheet:
            - DE = DEN = data enable. High when pixels are being fed. Goes low between
                lines and low for a while between frames.
            - DCLK = CLKIN = pixel clock (40 MHz, page 7 of datasheet).
                - Keith runs it at 30-33 MHz.
            - VDD = signal power (3.3V).
            - VGH = Voltage of the high gate (positive voltage).
            - VEE = Voltage of the emitter (negative voltage).
                - The above two are in a timing diagram (7.1), but are not pins on the display,
                    so I don't think I have to worry about that timing diagram.
            - HSD = horizontal sync.
            - VSD = vertical sync.
            - I think these are internal to the LCD:
                - STV = input vertical scan start signal.
                - CLKV
                - OEV
        - Two modes:
            - HV mode:
                - Bring VSD down between frames for ? clocks.
                - Bring HSD down between rows for ? clocks.
                    - Bring down at start of VSD, then a few times more before first row.
                        See page 9.
            - DE mode:
                - Raise DE at start of row, probably half a cycle before posedge of clock.
                - Data is captured on posedge of clock.
                - Bring down at least 2 clocks between rows.
                - Bring down at least 2048 clocks between frames.
        - Voltage levels:
            - Display is 3.3V for VDD and data.
            - Display is 9.9V (9.3V to 10.5V, 120mA) for backlight.
            - FPGA is 3.3V.
    - Pins:
        - 8 red
        - 8 green
        - 8 blue
        - HSync
        - VSync
        - Clock
        - On/off?
- Cobbler:
    - Pins 2 and 4 are connected (5V0).
        - 2 = D0
        - 4 = D1
    - Pins 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, 39 are connected (GND).
        - 6 = D3
        - 9 = D6
        - 14 = D9
        - 20 = D14
        - 25 = D18
        - 30 = GND
        - 34 = D25
        - 39 = D30
    - This leaves 32 - 2 - 8 = 22 pins.
    - We need 28 pins, so we're screwed.
    - Unless we use the other connector.
    - Or use fewer bits of color:
        - 6 bits of each of RGB would be 6*3 + 4 = 22 pins.
- GPIO headers:
    - See Figure 4-14 and Table 4.8 (page 32) in User Manual.
    - Both are 40 pins.
        - J4 (GPIO 0) is inner one.
        - J5 (GPIO 1) is outer one.
    - Both provide:
        - 36 GPIO pins.
            - 4 PLL clock input and output.
        - +5.0 V (measured at 4.6 V)
        - +3.3 V (measured at 3.3 V)
        - 2 x GND
    - They seem symmetric. Let's pick the outer one (GPIO 1).
